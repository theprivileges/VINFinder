# VIN Finder App

Demo application that allows a end-user to lookup their vehicle VIN using Trellis SDK. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### Use Trellis Demo Account

If youâ€™d like to use the widget without a real account, append `?t=1` to the [URL](http://localhost:3000/?t=1) in your web browser as you access your page.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
